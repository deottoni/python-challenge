    "* In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)\n",

    "  * The net total amount of \"Profit/Losses\" over the entire period\n",

    "  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period\n",
